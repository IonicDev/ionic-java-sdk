sdkerror.40006.message=The agent was used before being initialized.
sdkerror.40007.message=Agent initialization was performed twice.
sdkerror.40008.message=Fingerprint creation failed.
sdkerror.40009.message=A network request failed.
sdkerror.40010.message=The parsing of some serialized data failed.

sdkerror.42000.message=error code range base (Java)
sdkerror.42001.message=SDK initialization failed.  This can be due to the use of an out-of-date JRE that does not \
  support 256 bit AES keys (reference JDK-8170157 for information to correct this issue).
sdkerror.42002.message=SDK initialization failed.  This can be due to the use of a JRE that does not support \
  needed cryptography primitives.  The bouncycastle library (1.56+) may be added to the JRE security providers \
  to correct this issue.

sdkerror.50000.message=Crypto error code range base
sdkerror.50001.message=A general error occurred, but its specific problem is not represented with its own code.
sdkerror.50002.message=An unknown and unexpected error occurred.
sdkerror.50003.message=A null pointer was passed to one of the crypto functions.
sdkerror.50004.message=An invalid input value was encountered.  (An input value was found that is invalid.  For \
  example, a buffer length input was equal to zero.)
sdkerror.50005.message=CryptoAbstract module has not been initialized.
sdkerror.50006.message=Memory allocation error.  (This can happen if there is not a sufficient amount of memory \
  available to perform an operation.)
sdkerror.50007.message=Key validation error.  (A key was loaded or generated that did not pass validation.  For \
  example, this may happen when loading or generating an RSA private key.)
sdkerror.50008.message=Message signature verification error.  (A message signature verification failed.  This can be \
  returned by RSA signature verification functions.)
sdkerror.50009.message=A seed overflow occurred during RSA private key generation.  During RSA private key \
  generation, it is possible for the random seed to overflow (although extremely unlikely).  In that situation, RSA \
  key generation is aborted and the ISCRYPTO_RSA_SEED_OVERFLOW error code is returned.\n\n\
  When this error is encountered, it is recommended to simply try again.
sdkerror.50010.message=The attempted operation is not supported.  It may have been deprecated or not applicable for a \
  variation of the interface.
sdkerror.50011.message=Fatal error.
